# SAT-Solving: Project 1 

## Instructions

You can start the raw solver without the gui from terminal with `python main.py` on root level. By default, it will solve the first the file, you can customise the input by providing the number of you test file, i.e. `python main.py 8`. The GUI can be started with `python gui.py`.
